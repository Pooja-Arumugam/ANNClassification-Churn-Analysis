# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) + Web Deployment

This project is a **complete machine learning pipeline** built to predict customer churn using Artificial Neural Networks. It includes everything from raw data ingestion and exploratory analysis to model training, evaluation, and **deployment using Streamlit**. The goal is to simulate a real-world machine learning solution for a SaaS/telecom/banking business use case.

## 🧾 Executive Summary

**Business Context:**  
Customer churn represents a significant revenue leak for subscription-based businesses. Predicting churn enables targeted interventions to improve retention.

**Goal:**  
To build a scalable, interpretable, and deployable churn prediction model trained on structured customer data, and expose it through a user-friendly web application.

**Target Users:**  
- Business analysts looking for insights on customer behavior  
- Retention teams needing a real-time prediction tool  
- Hiring managers evaluating full-stack ML skills

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Simulated telco/banking customer dataset
- **File:** `Churn_Modelling.csv`
- **Samples:** ~10,000 rows
- **Target:** `Exited` (1 = churned, 0 = retained)
- **Type:** Tabular structured data
